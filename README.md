To view the _notes_, you need the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app.

Steps:
- Install _obsidian_
- Install the _git community plugin_, [Github](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git)
- Open command palette and find "Git: Clone an existing remote repo"
- Enter https://github.com/aki-masaki/info-prep
- Since the repo is _public_, no credentials are needed
- Enter a name for the sub directory, e.g. `repo`
- Then using a _file manager_, move all `repo` files **including** the `.git` folder inside the vault you created.
- All done now! ðŸ¥³
